# Gather-data-bot

My Python-based web scraping bot automates the collection of restaurant data from websites.  It uses libraries like Beautiful Soup and Requests to navigate target sites and parse HTML content.  The bot starts by accessing a list of restaurant URLs.  For each restaurant, it fetches the main page, extracts key information (name, address, cuisine, etc.), and then navigates to individual menu or details pages if available.  Beautiful Soup facilitates parsing the HTML structure, allowing the bot to pinpoint and extract specific data points.

A crucial aspect of the bot is its comprehensive logging system.  For every step, from initial URL access to data extraction and navigation to sub-pages, a detailed log entry is generated. This log records timestamps, URLs visited, data extracted, and any errors encountered.  This detailed logging is essential for debugging, monitoring the bot's progress, and ensuring data quality.  The collected data is then stored in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON), ready for analysis or further use. This automated process saves significant time and effort compared to manual data collection.
