1,5.0,First time here & it didn't disappoint. Shared several appetizers & one main dish followed by the cookie dessert & every dish was wow!! It was also $1 oyster night. Every dish was to perfection. Highly recommend this little gem. Angelo & his staff are top!! Dishes & cutlery were changed at every dish. A definite repeat.View more,"Dec 10, 2024"
1,4.0,Bon souper haut de gamme au bar devant l'√©cran pour la game du Canadien. On nous offre un limoncello en apportant la facture. Tr√®s belle attention. Le propri√©taire √©tait sur place les 4 fois o√π nous avons souper √† ce restaurant. On sent une ambiance sp√©ciale. On reviendra.View more,"Dec 9, 2024"

1,5.0,"It was a great culinary experience. The oysters were just the right size. The croquette was out of this world. Le M√©daillon was just ""melt in your mouth."" Tartare was not your typical & the lobster roll shrimp was plentiful & bun was homemade & just the perfect size! & the dessert - don't get me started! A definite repeat! - Dora (aka Karen)View more","Dec 5, 2024"

1,3.0,"Food is good. We had fish & chips, lobster rolls, calamari, oysters, steak, & tartare. I've been here about 3 times over the past 2 years. Portions are getting smaller. It's expensive. Service is a bit'hit & miss'. Starts off good & then they tend to forget you. I like the atmosphere. Average place. You could do a lot better however you most certainly can do a lot worst.View more","Nov 28, 2024"
