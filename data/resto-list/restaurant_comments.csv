1,5.0,"It was a great culinary experience. The oysters were just the right size. The croquette was out of this world. Le M√©daillon was just ""melt in your mouth."" Tartare was not your typical & the lobster roll shrimp was plentiful & bun was homemade & just the perfect size! & the dessert - don't get me started!

1,3.0,"Food is good. We had fish & chips, lobster rolls, calamari, oysters, steak, & tartare. I've been here about 3 times over the past 2 years. Portions are getting smaller. It's expensive. Service is a bit'hit & miss'. Starts off good & then they tend to forget you. I like the atmosphere. Average place. You could do a lot better however you most certainly can do a lot worst.View more","Nov 28, 2024"

The owners, kitchen & staff (Valentina) were very hospitable & shared the authenticity of this place. They even have an authentic certificate that attests the high quality ingredients from Italy.

4,5.0,"My favorite place in the area!! We love it. Our favorites are salt & pepper squid, general tao, orange beef, crispy noodles with vegetables & egg rolls. Lately we tried the lunch special, it is a huge platter & includes soup & a roll as well. Cheap, delicious & filling! Lunch special is only for weekdays. But no matter what time it is when it is, if you are looking for comfort food, you should try Kam Shing! The staff is very friendly & fun. We never had a bad experience so far given that we visit there very often. They even gave us some plants from the restaurant. If you are in the area, don't look for another place, try Kam Shing üòç Thank you soo so much for everything!!View more","Apr 4, 2024"

5,5.0,"(The English version follows) Je recommande grandement une visite au ""Brasseurs du Monde!"" C'√©tait notre premi√®re fois dans ce fantastique petit pub-restaurant & ce ne sera certainement pas la derni√®re. Notre serveuse, Marianne, √©tait sans aucun doute la meilleure que nous ayons jamais eue. Elle √©tait incroyablement professionnelle, dynamique, amicale & exceptionnellement bien inform√©e sur la s√©lection & l'accord des bi√®res. Ma femme & moi avons √©t√© trait√©s comme des VIP pendant toute la soir√©e ! La s√©lection de bi√®res √©tait excellente. Nous avons go√ªt√© huit bi√®res diff√©rentes &, pour la premi√®re fois au cours de nos nombreuses aventures de d√©gustation de bi√®res, nous avons vraiment aim√© chacune d'entre elles. Voici nos notes personnelles bas√©es sur nos go√ªts. S√©lection de bi√®res no.1 Blonde Qu√©bec : 9.5/10 Rousse du Pub. : 10/10 (Coup de coeur) Blanche du Pub : 7.5/10 West Coast IPA : 8/10 S√©lection de bi√®res no.2 Neipa de Course : 8/10 Doppelbock : 10/10 (Coup de coeur) C√©l√©brante : 9/10 IPA : 8/10 L'atmosph√®re √©tait anim√©e & invitante, avec une ambiance amicale & dynamique. Au fur & √† mesure que l'endroit se remplissait, il devenait un peu bruyant, car les beaux murs de pierre n'offraient pas beaucoup d'insonorisation. Mais c'√©tait un petit prix √† payer pour une exp√©rience aussi unique & agr√©able. Nous recommandons vivement de prendre le temps de visiter ce petit bijou. A la v√¥tre ! -------- Five Stars Review-------- I highly recommend a visit to "" Brasseurs du Monde!"" This was our first time at this fantastic little pub-restaurant & it certainly won't be our last. Our waitress, Marianne, was without a doubt the best we've ever had. She was incredibly professional, dynamic, friendly & exceptionally knowledgeable about beer selection & pairing. My wife & I were treated like VIPs the entire evening! The beer selection was outstanding. We tasted eight different beers & for the first time in our many beer tasting adventures, we really liked every one of them. Here are our personal notes based on our tastes. Beer Selection #1 Blonde Qu√©bec : 9.5/10 Rousse du Pub. : 10/10 (Coup de coeur) Blanche du Pub : 7.5/10 West Coast IPA : 8/10 Beer Selection #2 Neipa de Course : 8/10 Doppelbock : 10/10 (Coup de coeur) C√©l√©brante : 9/10 IPA : 8/10 The atmosphere was lively & inviting, with a friendly, dynamic vibe. As the place filled up, it got a little noisy, as the beautiful stone walls don't provide much soundproofing. But it was a small price to pay for such a unique & enjoyable experience. We highly recommend taking the time to visit this little gem. Cheers!View more","Jan 2, 2025"

The beer is probably good, but I made the mistake of not having beer. I accidentally ordered the worst wine on the menu. I think I just got unlucky, which is why it's 2 stars not 1 stars from me.
