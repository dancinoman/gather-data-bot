Report an error","At Moghel Tandoori, we felt that there was a need for a ""Fine Dining"" restaurant unlike any other in the area. We strove to make it beautiful and comfortable, luxurious and inviting and of course provide delicious Indian dishes that were missing in the area. Our menu incorporates fresh ingredients from within our locale and specialty ingredients imported from abroad. Each of our specialties honours the fine traditions of Indian culinary arts. Our master-chef comes directly from India, bringing with him over 20 years of global experience, specializing in the preparation of authentic northern Indian dishes. We invite you and yours to experience the sights, sounds and flavours of Indian fare right here in your very own backyard. Whether it's a dinner for two, or a private party of 10, Moghel Tandoori Restaurant is sure to please. We look forward to seeing you soon and often!!!show more"
