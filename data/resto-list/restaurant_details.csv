Today, La Banquise remains a family business. Mr. Barsalou’s youngest daughter Annie took over in the 1990s along with her partner Marc Latendresse. Together, they maintain both the tradition of quality and the excellent reputation of the La Banquise Restaurant. In summer 2006, La Banquise underwent major renovations and a much larger dining area was made available. 40 years on, La Banquise is now much more than a simple snack bar or poutine joint.

Over the years, Delmo has had its share of facelifts; the 18 bar-stools surrounding the granite bar are all that are left of the original 38.  The iron sign outside and its original lighted tulips, were salvaged and still greet all our clients.  The destruction of the original porcelain tile frieze that decorated the walls behind the bar prompted us to ask local muralist and celebrated artist, Carlito DalCeggio, to reproduce his version of the scenic garden party adorned with the verse from 18th English poet John Gay, “from wine what sudden friendship springs”.show more"

After earning his degree in hotel and restaurant management, he worked for the Accor Group as director of hotel-restaurant in the southwest of France, a bastion of French gastronomy. He opened his first crêperie in Fort Lauderdale, on the coast of Florida, in the United States. This success and some leisure travel to the beautiful city of Montreal, prompted him to return and try the Quebec experience. He opened a decoration boutique in downtown Montreal, on Amherst Street, which he calls Karactère with a ""K"". Despite the success of this enterprise, he misses restauration. He decides to close the shop and starts a project that is closer to his love of gastronomy by opening a crêperie in the now trendy district known as Griffintown. He sets his sights on a former hairdressing studio that he completely transforms to create Spanel, the Breton word for ""spatula"" Spatula for turning pancakes. Spanel's philosophy is based on a cuisine made exclusively with fresh, quality products. Thanks to the proximity of the Atwater Market, Yann can fulfill his wish to serve his customers crepes and gourmet dishes.

684,20,"$ (less than $20), $$ ($20 to $30)",,"Known as a Montreal institution, Le Taj has been deeply entrenched in the downtown core for over 3 decades. The decor at Le Taj represents a true synthesis of the complex, the colourful, the simple and the elegant. Carefully curated with handmade wooden carvings from the early 18th century, juxtaposed with the 12-foot mud wall adorning the backdrop of the dining room - which was in fact the central installation from the Indian Pavilion at Expo ‘67 - the decor often leaves our guests speechless while maintaining a certain feeling of warmth that mirrors the cuisine. At the rear end of the restaurant, our tandoor (traditional clay oven) is visible through a glass wall, leaving guests with a window into the world of our chefs, who can be seen cooking tandoori delicacies from fresh naan to our signature tandoori chicken.Owner, Vinod Kapoor, opened the restaurant in 1985, with the idea of creating a space where Indian food could be devoured within the respected setting it deserved: white table clothes, fine wine and a decor that highlights the rich cultural and artistic history of his native India. Having previously been a collector and dealer of Indian art and antiques, his keen eye for interesting pieces has made its impression on the ambiance of the restaurant, where most of the artwork is one of a kind (including a piece from the Indian Pavilion at Expo ’67!). It is with this same passion that Mr. Kapoor, who can still be seen buzzing around the dining room on a busy night, continues to maintain the high quality and exceptional service to old and new clients alike. Over the years, Le Taj has become a staple for many Montrealers and international clients, with a number of patrons having grown up dining with us and coming back over time with families of their own. In that respect, our own family of dedicated staff members - many of whom have been with us since the very beginning - are in large part how we have built our reputation of excellence for over 30 years. With a large number of our regular patrons making up a who's who, and having been as loyal to us as we have been to them and to our classical recipes, we hope to continue our journey in the mastery of culinary arts and service for many years to come.show more"

During the first 60 years, several members of their families worked at the restaurant and left their contributions and memories with the customers. La Binerie Mont-Royal has become a culinary institution in Quebec, which is proud to offer authentic Quebec cuisine to all those who want to remember the good experiences of family meals. Memorable experiences are created for all new customers! July 13th, 1966 Leo buys his brother's restaurant.

So when Leo decided to retire - he knew that there was someone to take his place! August 4th, 1978, after 40 years of service, Leo sells La Binerie Mont-Royal to Fernand and Claire. The two work together for over 30 years! March 10th, 2001, the secret recipes of La Binerie Mont-Royal are given to a trio of restaurants in Quebec which brought some physical improvements to the restaurant. In March 2002, the torch of Quebec cuisine was purchased and continued by Suzanne Touchette and Bernard Deschamps. November 17th, 2005, Jocelyne and Philippe Brunet became the happy recipients of La Binerie Mont-Royal. They were looking for several months for a restaurant that offered food and special experience, which also had development potential. In hopes of making a cozier restaurant, the bar and the tables are now solid maple and walls are covered with pictures of our family traditions from the great Quebec illustrator Joseph-Edmond Massicotte. Several improvements in the menu were made and continue to be, so that the dishes offered can live up to the required quality, while respecting the authenticity of the Quebec cuisine! They like to offer their loyal customers and the many visitors from other countries, the pleasure of enjoying traditional dishes, making sure they leave with a good memory!
